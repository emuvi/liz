# Roudmap
All desired features for this project will be documented in this file.

## Debug and Verbose
I shall map on each parameter variable with rux_dbg_call on the start of the sensible functions.
I shall map on each variable assigment with rux_dbg_step on the plain body of the sensible functions.
I shall map on each variable assigment with rux_dbg_tell on the iterations of the sensible functions.
I shall map on each return expressions with rux_dbg_reav on the conclusion of the sensible functions.
I shall map erros with rux_dbg_erro on each returned Displayable error inside the sensible functions.
I shall map erros with rux_dbg_bleb on each returned LizError inside the sensible functions.
