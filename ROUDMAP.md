I shall map on each parameter variable with dbg_step inside the sensible functions.
I shall map on each variable assigment with dbg_step inside the sensible functions.
I shall map erros with dbg_err on each returning error inside the sensible functions.
I shall map erros with dbg_ebb on each returning LizError inside the sensible functions.
