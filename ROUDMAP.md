All desired features for this project will be documented in this file.

I shall place as many debug macros on the code as the need arises.
I shall map on each parameter variable with dbg_step inside the sensible functions.
I shall map on each variable assigment with dbg_step inside the sensible functions.
I shall map erros with dbg_erro on each returning error inside the sensible functions.
I shall map erros with dbg_bleb on each returning LizError inside the sensible functions.
